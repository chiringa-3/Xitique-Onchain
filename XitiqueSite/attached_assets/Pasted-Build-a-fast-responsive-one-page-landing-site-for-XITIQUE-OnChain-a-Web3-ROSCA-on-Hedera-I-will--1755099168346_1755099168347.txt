Build a fast, responsive one-page landing site for XITIQUE OnChain (a Web3 ROSCA on Hedera). I will upload the logo file; use it in the navbar and hero. Keep it clean, modern, mobile-first, and accessible (WCAG AA). Prefer a neutral light look with bold accents.

Brand & Visual Direction

Vibe: trust + community + innovation.

Colors: neutral base (white/near-white), charcoal text, accent inspired by African textile tones (emerald/teal + warm gold). Use accents sparingly for buttons, links, and highlights.

Typography: geometric sans for headings, humanist sans for body. Strong hierarchy.

Subtle micro-animations (fade/slide) on hero headline, CTA buttons, and feature cards. Smooth scroll.


Structure (Single Page)

1. Sticky Navbar

Left: XITIQUE logo (uploaded).

Right links (scroll): About, How it Works, Features, Tech, Team, FAQ, Contact.

CTA button: “Follow on X”.



2. Hero (above the fold)

Headline: “From Tradition to Blockchain.”

Subheadline: “XITIQUE modernizes community savings (ROSCA) with Hedera smart contracts—secure, transparent, and borderless.”

Primary CTA: “Join the Movement” (links to Discord: https://discord.gg/NHjRZzYC)

Secondary CTA (outline): “Read the Litepaper” (links to https://living-bowl-f51.notion.site/Whitepaper-122d53cbd8c28060826fc2f36e511014)

Background: subtle mesh/gradient with a faint network motif.



3. About

“In many African communities, Xitique (ROSCA) means trust, discipline, and mutual support. XITIQUE OnChain turns that tradition into a Web3 experience—so groups can contribute and rotate funds with clarity and automation.”



4. Problem → Solution

Problems (icons): lack of transparency, borders & banking friction, manual enforcement.

Solutions: automated contributions & penalties, auditable history, global access, non-custodial design.



5. How It Works

4 steps with numbered cards:

1. Create or join a contribution group


2. Set amount & frequency


3. Smart contract automates contributions & rules


4. Receive the pooled funds on your turn





6. Key Features

Blockchain Security — “Trust the code, not a middleman.”

Full Transparency — “Every contribution. Publicly auditable.”

Automated Rules — “On-time payments. Fair rotations.”

Global Access — “Save together, across borders.”



7. Tech Stack

Built on Hedera, Prisma, Replit, etc.
